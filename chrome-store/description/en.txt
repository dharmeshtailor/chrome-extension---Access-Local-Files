In Google Chrome, links to local files are disabled, unlike IE.
This extension allows you to open a link to a local file by clicking it.

[Security]
A malicious page can not open a local file without permission, because this extension reacts only to the click operation by the user.

[Others]
Personal information is not collected / used.
Source code is released to GitHub (see "Website" link).
